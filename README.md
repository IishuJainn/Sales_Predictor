# LogisticRegression-API
This repository contains code to predict whether a user will buy a product or not based on a social network ad. The prediction is based on a Logistic Regression model that has been trained on the Social_Network_Ads.csv dataset. The model is saved using Pickle for later use in the API. The API is created using Flask, which allows the model to be used through a web-based interface.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
The following libraries must be installed before running the code:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

flask

pickle

## Installing
Clone this repository onto your local machine:

The API will be available at http://localhost:5000. The homepage contains a form where you can input the features for a user and make a prediction on whether they will buy a product from a social network ad.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of creating a machine learning API using Flask. The API can be used to make predictions based on a trained Logistic Regression model. The code can be modified and improved to fit other use cases.
